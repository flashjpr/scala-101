# Scala 101

The aim of this repository is to serve as a starting point and put you up to speed on developing Scala application. The incentive to work with scala started after I needed a fast computation engine for a decent amount of data. This led to using Spark. I have initially implemented Spark using Java and very soon had I found out that Scala and Spark tend to behave politely one with each other. 

## Requirements

* JRE (JDK will do as well) - Scala runs on the JVM
* Scala - https://www.scala-lang.org/download/
* SBT (simple build tool) - http://www.scala-sbt.org/
* IDE of choice (note that there is a Scala-IDE based on Eclipse - http://scala-ide.org/)

If you are using Windows JRE has to be present in the PATH and the msi installers for Scala and SBT should have added both scala and sbt to the PATH env var.

## Start Scala 

Via command-line:
* just type **scala**
* to exit just type **:q**

### SBT
